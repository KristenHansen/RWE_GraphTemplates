# RWE_GraphTemplates
Templates for plotting in the Python and R in and outside the Enclave. Additionally conventions around naming of files and folders

Need to create files for ggplot2, seaborn and matplotlib. Ggplot2 will be split into plots and maps separately for ease of template use.

This will result in 4 files and then an additional file for plotting in an enclave environment
